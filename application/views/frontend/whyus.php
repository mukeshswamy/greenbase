                    At Greenbase, we are planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure in a manner
                    that properly manages any potentially negative environmental, social and health and safety effects,
                    while enhancing positive impacts. Leveraging the Group’s established track record of obtaining
                    approvals, completing construction and delivering projects in record time all the while exceeding
                    our regulatory requirements through our expert team of in-house professionals in engineering, legal
                    and liasioning, Greenbase will assist its clients in obtaining required approvals. This can be seen
                    across our parks where we have either applied for or obtained approvals such as Integrated
                    Industrial Area (IIA), Environmental Clearance (EC) etc. beforehand so that our clients can start
                    their operations immediately on handover
